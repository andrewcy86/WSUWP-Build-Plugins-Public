# WSU Custom CSS

WSU Custom CSS is a fork of the custom CSS module from Jetpack.

The general reason for the fork was to maintain a slimmer version without the overhead that comes with Jetpack.

We do our best to track appropriate upstream changes, though it is possible the direction of the plugin changes over time.
